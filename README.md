# Housing Unaffordability : A Closer Look at Rent Trends and Homelessness
This project was a focus on homelessness and correlations with rising rent prices throughout the years, and how that impacted homelessness in different counties/communities.

We used python to manipulate our data, and create visualizations of our findings and then wrote a report demonstrating the findings and how that answers our research questions.
